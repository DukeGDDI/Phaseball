# Phaseball 

---

**Game Title:** *Phaseball*

**Genre:** Physics-Based Arcade

**Platforms:** Steam (PC+Mac), Apple Arcade (iPhone,iPad,AppleTV)

**Perspective:** Fixed First-Person (portrait, like real pinball table)

**Target Audience:** Ages 10+, physics sandbox fans, arcade enthusiasts

**Game Mode:** Single Player

### 🔥 HIGH CONCEPT

*Phaseball* reinvents the classic pinball experience by fusing physical simulation with dynamic material-shifting gameplay. As the ball rolls through a glowing, cybernetic table, it phases between materials—each changing how it behaves, bounces, and scores. Combined with magnetic fields, blowers, and other environmental physics, the table becomes a reactive playground of skill, strategy, and chaos.

### 🎯 CORE GAME LOOP

1. **Launch Ball**
2. **Control Flippers to Keep Ball Alive**
3. **Ball Phases via Gates into New Materials**
4. **Interact with Physics Objects (Magnets, Fans, etc.)**
5. **Score Combos, Unlock Bonuses, Trigger “Multiball”**
6. **Lose Ball / Start Next Ball → Repeat until no balls remain**

### ✨ UNIQUE SELLING POINTS (USPs)

### 🧪 **Ball Phasing System**

The ball can dynamically shift between material states, each affecting movement and interactions:

| Material | Behavior | Strategic Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Metal | Slow, heavy. magnetic | Stable for precision shots |
| Rubber | Bouncy | Great for chaos combos |
| Ice | Slippery, fast | Hard to control, reaches distant targets, fragile (chips/shatters) |
| Clay | Dampened, slow | Deforms on impact, looses roundness, rolls unpredictably |
| Gel | Jiggly, bouncy | Unpredictable but fun |
| Plasma | Floaty, magnetic | Interacts with special fields |

> Each state changes physical materials, visual FX, and audio.
> 

### 🌪️ **Environmental Physics Interactions**

The table isn't static — it's alive with reactive physics:

- **Blowers & Vacuums**: Control or disrupt ball trajectory.
- **Magnets**: Attract or repel plasma-phase balls.
- **Pulse Zones**: Temporarily alter gravity or friction.
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: React to player's material state.

> Turn pinball from "watch and react" to "plan and adapt."

## 💡Additional Ideas to Consider

- Infinite table - instead of a single set of flippers, ramps etc, as the ball either falls between the paddles or is launched above the highest point of the table view, the table “loads” a new level (set of flippers, bumpers etc) and the game continues.  You can move “up” the levels and “fall back” down to earlier levels in lieu of just loosing the ball.
